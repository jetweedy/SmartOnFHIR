# SmartOnFHIR

Developing a variety of Launchers and App pages using HTML and JavaScript to Demo various contexts and functionality when using FHIR to interact with Epic and similar EHR systems.

## How to use:

Use a launcher like this one...
http://launch.smarthealthit.org/

Download the repository and save to a localhost-accessible local website URL **or** upload to a web server for access through a web URL.

Enter the URL (to the ...launch.html page) in the smarthealthit launch form and click Launch.

I'll be updating this with better examples as I go forward.
